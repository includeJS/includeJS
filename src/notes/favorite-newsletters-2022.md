I'm an inbox 0(ish) type of gal. Today, my inbox contains between five and fifteen emails (it used to be around 10k!), primarily unread newsletters.

I spend around 30 minutes reading the newsletters (about two or three every day). Then, depending on the newsletter type, I either add some notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), add some flashcards to [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), bookmark the articles, forward relevant bits to my friends or hit unsubscribe.

My bookmarks live inside my 'Reading' folder inside the Firefox browser. I again try to process two or three items each day (currently, that folder has 28 links! ðŸ˜±).

If possible, I read everything with [Firefox's reader view](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-reader-view-clutter-free-web-pages) (not all websites allow it) - it has a nice big font and fewer distractions.

I try to be ruthless when it comes to unsubscribing or deleting bookmarks - if something has lingered in my inbox for more than a month, that clearly means I'm not interested, so bin it is. Life's too short, and there's an unending flow of interesting/useful information.

I also try no to stress about it, and if at some point I accumulate too many of these unprocessed items, I just do a mass delete and start all over.I'm an inbox 0(ish) type of gal. Today, my inbox contains between five and fifteen emails (it used to be around 10k!), primarily unread newsletters.

The newsletters I'm currently reading can roughly be divided into three categories: everything internet (online culture, trends, memes), programming (front-end development and general computer science principles) & computers (Mac OS, productivity), and language & culture.

## Everything internet
- [Garbage Day](https://www.garbageday.email/):  Meme explainers, Tweet analyzers, social media trends (e.g., the slow death of Facebook, explainers of weird TikTok algorithms, conspiracy theories, the NFT madness, furries...?). Great for a general overview of what's happening online, sent several times a week.
- [Culture Study](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/the-back-to-the-office-maximum?s=r): deep dive into online culture and trends, often featuring interviews with authors or members of academia. Single topic, more in-depth. Sent... weekly?
- [Why Is this Interesting](https://whyisthisinteresting.substack.com/): different contributors, essays on various topics (e.g., how to find good olive oil, GeoGuesser, electric car wheels). Short, sent several times a week.
- [The Best Song Ever](https://bestsong.substack.com/): deep dive into the history of a different song every week. Great for finding good music or reading up on your favorite authors.
- [The Whippet](https://thewhippet.org/): very random musings.
- [Weekly Fillet](https://newsletter.weeklyfilet.com/). Five links from around the web, weekly. [In praise of memorization](http://www.pearlleff.com/in-praise-of-memorization) was one of my recent favorite ones.

## Programming & computers
- [Software Lead Weekly](https://softwareleadweekly.com/): recommended articles on software development and leadership
- [Pointer](https://www.pointer.io/): a reading club for software developers, weekly
- [Obsidian Roundup](https://www.obsidianroundup.org/): news, updates on the open-source note-taking tool Obsidian
- [Stefan's Web Weekly](https://www.stefanjudis.com/newsletter/): web development news & productivity tips from my buddy Stefan. Weekly
- [Labnotes](https://labnotes.org/): quick tech roundup, funny, lots of Twitter links, weekly
- [OSx Daily](https://osxdaily.com/): daily tip for mac computers, iPhones, and iPads

## Language & culture
- [Mandarax](https://www.mandarax.mx/): monthly newsletter from my favorite podcast! Everyday science (in Spanish). *Mandarax lo explica todo!*
- [Chaoyang Trap](https://chaoyangtrap.house/): nuanced reporting on Chinese internet culture in the form of a group chat. The most recent "episode" was on [Shanghai's lockdown](https://chaoyang.substack.com/p/shanghai-lockdown). Loooooong (but worth it).
