## Syntax

- `print("hello, world")`
- No semicolons!
- No need to declare variable types
- you don't even have to declare them in advance with a `var` or similar keyword
- file extension is `.py`
- to execute: `python program.py`
- for importing libraries: `from CS50 import get_string`
- no `main` function!
- `or` instead of `||`
- you can use single or double quotes around characters (only single in C)
- in python everything that is character-based is a string; it doesn't matter which quotes you use as long as  you're consistent
- `# this is a comment`
- `elif` (instead of `else if`)
- `not` instead of `!=`
- ternary operator: `letter_only = True if input().isalpha() else False` ðŸ¤¯
- no `do while` loops
- there's no `i++` or `i--`
- `print()` adds a new line by default (so you don't need to add `\n` yourself)
- `append()` vs `push()` for lists (they're not arrays)
- `None` instead of `NULL`

```python
from cs50 import get_string

answer = get_string("What's your name? ")
# no need to deal with separate placeholders
print("hello, " + answer)
# OR
print(f"hello, {answer}"
# you can use formatted string with any string function not just printf ðŸ’¡
```

- `counter++` doesn't exist in Python (`counter += 1`)

```python
# no curly braces, no semi-colons, no extra lines
# but yes, indentation!

# pay attention, : instead of {
if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
# instead of else if
elif x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")
else:
    print("x is equal to y")
```

## Loops

```python

# capitalizing the booleans
while True:
    print("hello, world")

i = 0
while i < 3:
    print("hello, world")
    i += 1

for i in [0, 1, 2]:
    print("cough")

# or
for i in range(3):

```

## Data types

- Loosely typed language - variable type is inferred from its value (as opposed to C that is a strongly-typed language)
- `bool`, `float`, `int`, `str` but also
- `range`, `list` (an array that automatically re-sizes itself), `tuple`, `dict`, `set` (a collection of values without duplicates)
- no `double` or `long`

## Speller in Python

```python
words = set()

# this is how you define a function in python
def load(dictionary):
  file = open(dictionary, "r")
  for line in file:
      words.add(line.rstrip())
  file.close()
  return True

def check(word):
    if word.lower() in words:
        return True
    else:
        return False

def size():
    return len(words)

def unload():
    return True

```

**ðŸ¤” Why is Python slower than C?**

- because Python has to do more work for us with general-purpose solutions, like for memory management
- you are also incurring some overhead by running the Python interpreter, which reads our source code and translates it to code that our CPU can understand, line by line.

## More Python Code

### Getting user input
```python
answer = input("What's your name? ")
print(f"hello, {answer}")
```

### Check if a string is in a list

```python
# this is pretty neat
if s.lower() in ["y", "yes"]:
```

### No function prototype, but
```python
# you still need to define something before calling it
def main():
    meow(3)

def meow(n):
    for i in range(n):
        print("meow")

main()

```

### Looping over characters of a string

```python
for c in s:
	# the second argument overrides the default \n
    print(c.upper(), end="")
```

### Working with command-line arguments

```python
from sys import argv

if len(argv) == 2:
    print(f"hello, {argv[1]}")
else:
    print("hello, world")
```

### Exit errors

```python
# importing the entire library here
import sys

if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    print("missing command-line argument")
    sys.exit(1)
print(f"hello, {sys.argv[1]}")
sys.exit(0)

```


### Lists

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# insert 5 at position 4
nums.insert(4, 5)
```

### Dictionary
- aka associative array
- under the hood, they are implemented like a hash table
```python
from cs50 import get_string

people = {
    "Brian": "+1-617-495-1000",
    "David": "+1-949-468-2750"
}

name = get_string("Name: ")
if name in people:
    print(f"Number: {people[name]}")

```


**ðŸ¤” How do you run python locally?**

- always in a virtual environment (to make sure you are using the right version of Python when working on any specific project)
- A Virtual Environment in Python is a self-contained directory that holds a Python installation for a particular language version.

```bash
cd
mkdir pyworkshop
cd pyworkshop
python3.7 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
# and to kill it write deactivate
```

Some more nifty Python functions

- `type` for checking out the type of the variable
- `dir` for listing all the methods on the data type
- `help`
