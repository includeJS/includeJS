## Git Data Model

Git models the history of a collection of files and folders within some top-level directory (root directory, the directory in which you do `git init`) as a series of snapshots (commits).

ü§î **git init** creates the `.git` directory, which is where Git stores all of its information. If you delete everything except `.git`, you can still rebuild your entire repository.

In git folders are **trees**, and files are **blobs**. 

In pseudocode:

- A **file** is a bunch (array) of bytes:

`type blob = array<byte>`

- A **directory** contains named files and directories (mappings from the file/directory name to the actual contents - contents being another tree or a blob):

`type tree = map<string, tree | blob>`

- A **commit** has parents, metadata, and the top-level tree:
```
type commit = struct {
    parent: array<commit>
    author: string
    message: string
    snapshot: tree
}
```

## Objects and content-addressing

ü§î What do we mean by content-addressable? It means that at the core of Git is a simple key-value data store. This means you can insert any kind of content into a Git repository, for which Git will hand you back a unique key you can use later to retrieve that content. [More on git objects from Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects)

ü§î Also, the content of an object determines its ID (two files with the same content will have the same id!). The technical name for this is a content-addressable filesystem.

- An **object** is a blob, tree, or commit (see above):

`type object = blob | tree | commit`

In Git data store, all objects are content-addressed by their SHA-1 hash:

```
objects = map<string, object>

def store(object):
  // hash-object command
    id = sha1(object)
    objects[id] = object

def load(id):
    return objects[id]
```

ü§î A typical repo has thousands of objects, so Git breaks up objects into subdirectories to avoid any one directory becoming too large.

ü§î What is a hash function?

A hash function is a function that takes in a big piece of data and turns it into a short string.

## References

Branches and refs are human-readable labels to specific commits. "HEAD" is a reference to where we currently are. 

```
references = map<string, string>

// references are mutable
def update_reference(name, id):
    references[name] = id

def read_reference(name):
    return references[name]
// cat-file
def load_reference(name_or_id):
    if name_or_id in references:
        return load(references[name_or_id])
    else:
        return load(name_or_id)
```

üí° At a high level, all git command line commands are just manipulations of references data or objects data: 

- `git add` is a combination of `hash-object` and `update-index`.
- `git commit` comes from `write-tree`, `commit-tree`, and if you‚Äôre on a branch, `update-ref`
- `git checkout` uses `update-ref` or `update-symbolic-ref`

If you `ls .git` in a new git repository:

`HEAD   description   info    refs    config    hooks   objects`

- The **HEAD** file tells Git which branch we‚Äôre working on
- The **description** file is only used by the GitWeb program ‚Äì it can be ignored.
- The **info** directory has a single file, exclude, which contains a list of per-repo ignores. Like a gitignore file, but it doesn‚Äôt need to be checked in.
- The **refs** directory is empty
- The **config** file contains repo-specific configuration
- The **hooks** directory is used to store scripts that fire on certain events ‚Äì for example, running a linter before you commit
- The **objects** directory should be empty (aside from two more empty directories)

- You'll get the `index` file once you've added your changes to the staging area (a.k.a. **index**)


üí° Staging area is you telling git what changes should be included in the next snapshot.

- `git cat-file -p [commit sha]`

Git's internal command to print out the contents of the commit (used to inspect objects stored in Git). With this command, we can restore our file even if we delete it ‚Äì because the object is kept safe in the `.git` directory: 
```
$ rm animals.txt`
$ git cat-file -p b13311e04762c322493e8562e6ce145a899ce570 > animals.txt
```

## Misc Git Commands

- `git commit -a`

To commit all the changes for files that are already tracked - so you can potentially skip `git add .`

üí° Think of merging as being the opposite of branching. 

ü§î `git pull` === `git fetch & git merge`

- `git add -p`

For interactively deciding what you want to add.

- `git blame [filename]`

To see who made changes to the file.

- `git show [commit sha]`

To see the changes made in the commit.

- `git bisect`

Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug.
