Hi, and welcome! 👋

includeJS is written and maintained by me, Eva Dee 👩‍💻, a self-taught software developer.

🙋‍♀️I:

- **read** and **write** (checkout <a href='/tags'>Tags</a> to get an idea)
- **organise** <a href='/about/#heading-study-groups'>study groups</a>
- **have** a 🐕 and 🐈🐈
- **live** in Brussels 🍺🍟🍫
- **speak** 🇸🇮🇨🇳 🇬🇧 🏳️‍🌈🇪🇸 (well, sort of, see how I'm doing <a href='tags/spanish'>here</a>)
- **use** a lot of emojis 😬 (but somehow never managed to learn how to use gifs 🤷‍♀️)
