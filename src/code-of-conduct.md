The includeJS code of conduct applies to all meetups, streams, study groups and any other events (online or offline) or community's spaces, including public channels, private channels, and direct messages. Please make sure you familiarise yourself with it and let us know if you have any questions or concerns. Weâ€™re here to ensure we all have a good time and learn together!

## In short

includeJS is dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We are trans-friendly.

We do not tolerate harassment in any form. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for includeJS.

## Longer version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Every code of conduct violation report will be treated with seriousness and care.

Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for our community.

Reporting harassment
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the organizers (Eva Dee) immediately.
