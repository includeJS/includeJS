## On design

- **design**: a qualitative, subjective measure describing how well-written your code is.
- we strive to write no only **correct** code, but well-designed code
- the **style**, is the aesthetic that makes your code much more readable

## On compiling

- A program called a **compiler** will take source code as input and produce machine code as output.
- source code (C language) -> algorithm (compiler - `clang`) -> machine code (binary)
- `clang -o hello hello.c -lcs50` -> `make hello`
- **Header files** that end with `.h` refer to some other set of code, like a library, that we can then use in our program.
- this is how you `console.log` something in C:

```c
// a library that allows you to get user input
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	printf("hello, %s\n", answer );
	printf("%i\n", x + y);
}
```

## Data types

- `bool` for `true` or `false`
- `char` single ASCI characters: take up 1 byte (8 bits)
- `int` number: always take up 4 bytes (32 bits) of memory (meaning that you can't count higher than ~ 4 billion)
- unsigned `int` is a qualifier - it doubles the positive range of values that an integer can take on (but doesn't allow for negative values). There are also other qualifiers like `short`, `long` (64 bits), and `const`
  `long` really big number
- `float` number with decimals, take up 4bytes (32 bits) of memory, caution: there's a limit to how precise we can be with floats
- `double` number with many decimals, up to 8 bytes (64 bites) of memory
- `string` (must `#include <cs50.h>`)

### What will happen on January 19, 2038, 3:14:08??

In computing, the world was created on January 1, 1970. Computers have been counting time in seconds since the. On the specified date, the seconds will overflow the 32-bit integer (after 4 billion seconds have elapsed) and the computers will start counting in negative.
In short, the Year 2038 problem is caused by an insufficient number of bits chosen to represent time.

### More complex types

- `structs` (structures)
- `typedefs` (defined types)

**🤔 How about `void`?**

- `void` is a type, but not a data type:
- functions can have a `void` return type, which means they don't return a value (like `printf`)
- functions with `void` as parameters simply take no parameter

### Placeholders for data types

- `%c` char (make sure to use single quotes for `char`)
- `%i` int (integers are truncated floats! Everything after the period goes away.)
- `%f` float, double
- `%li` long
- `%s` string

### Casting

- you can cast or typecast one data type into another:

```c
// converting one of the ints is enough
float z = float(x) / y;
```

## Operators

- arithmetic operators
- boolean expressions (logical operators: `&&`, `||`, `!`, relational operators: `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`)

## Conditional statements

- `if`, `else if`, `else`
- `switch` statement
- ternary operators

## Loops

- `while`, `do while`, `for`

## Misc

- type of output -> `void main(void)` <- type of input
- All variables (when you declare them) need 2 things: type and name
- declaration vs assignment vs initialization (declaring + assigning at the same time)
- for a custom function, the convention in C is to write the function prototype, then use the function, then add the function definition at the bottom. This is the function prototype:

```c
void meow(void);
```

## Command line

- `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `rm`, `mv`

**🤔 What is a greedy algorithm?**

- A greedy algorithm is one “that always takes the best immediate, or local, solution while finding an answer. Greedy algorithms find the overall, or globally, an optimal solution for some optimization problems, but may find less-than-optimal solutions for some instances of other problems.”
