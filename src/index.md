Hi, and welcome! 👋

includeJS is written and maintained by me, Eva Dee 👩‍💻, a self-taught software developer.

🙋‍♀️I:

- **read** and **write** (checkout <a href='/tags'>Tags</a> to get an idea)
- **organise** includeJS <a href='/about/#heading-study-groups'>study groups</a> (and I've previously organised Django Girls workshops, Cryptoparties, NodeSchool workshops, Hackathons and a bazillion of meetups)
- **have** a 🐕 and 🐈🐈
- **live** in Brussels 🍺🍟🍫
- **speak** 🇸🇮🇨🇳🇬🇧🏳️‍🌈🇪🇸 (well, sort of, see how I'm doing <a href='tags/spanish'>here</a>)
- **use** a lot of emojis 😬 (but somehow never managed to learn how to use gifs 🤷‍♀️)

#### Projects

- [Getting fluent in Spanish 🇲🇽](https://includejs.dev/tags/spanish/ )
- [includeJS TV 📺](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUBwCv5KytWofgJKWtLcaAw) (some of my Twitch streams from the "Teach me something" series)
- [Boardgame Co-op 🎲](https://boardgame-coop.netlify.app/) (a collection of my favorite co-op boardgames for 2 players)
