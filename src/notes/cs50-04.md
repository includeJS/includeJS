## Hexadecimal

- We use hexadecimal notation to talk about computer memory.
- Base 16, hexadecimal base (0 - f) Remember `int`s are four byes.
- One hexadecimal digit is equivalent to four binary digits
- If you are using hexadecimal, the convention is to prefix every value with `0x`
- So... the `hex` color values are just the hexadecimal RGB values (and in a different format)!
- In C memory, values are stored in hexadecimal.

## Pointers

- A pointer is a variable that contains the address of some other value.
- `&` **"the address of"** operator (we use it every time we want to check what address a variable is stored at)
- `*` **"go to the address of"** operator(for telling your program to look inside a particular memory address). Also known as the dereferencing operator.
- `%p` - aka **pointer** - for the placeholder value to be interpreted as hexadecimal


```c
int n = 50;
prinf("%p\n", &n)
// returns eg: 0x123456789

// this will just print out 50
prinf("%i\n", *&n)

```

And if you want to store the address of some variable inside another variable, you would use a pointer (an `int star` variable):
```c
int n = 50;
int *p = &n;

// and to print the value stored at p
// get the value at the address
prinf("%i\n", *p)
```

- If you are getting the address of something, you must store it in a pointer (*).
- Pointers have 64 bits (the equivalent of a `long`)

A string is defined as back-to-back-to-back characters (one byte away, since a `char` take one byte of space in C).

- ü§Ø strings are just pointers pointing to the first character in the string
- the null terminating character signifies the end

```c
int n = 50;
int *p = &n;

string s = "EMMA";
char *s = "EMMA";
```

```c
typedef char *string;
```

üîà NEW STRING DEFINITION: A string is a variable that contains the address of a character, aka `char *`

```c
char *s = "EMMA";
printf("%p\n", s); // the address of the char
printf("%p\n, &s[0]); // the address of the 1st char (same as ^)

printf("%c\n", *s); // prints "E"

// pointer arithmetic
printf("%c\n", *(s+1)); // prints "M"

```

- when you're comparing two strings, if you just compare them like this `s == t` you are comparing their addresses in the memory, meaning these two strings will never be the same! (that's why you need to use `strcmp()` instead)

```c
// changing one, will change the other
 char *s = get_string("s: ");
    char *t = s;
    t[0] = toupper(t[0]);
```

## Malloc()

```c

// copying a string in c
// without using strcopy()
#include <cs50.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void)
{
    char *s = get_string("s: ");

    char *t = malloc(strlen(s) + 1);

	// when allocating memory always check that malloc
	// is giving you back a valid memory address and not NULL
    if (t == NULL)
    {
        return 1;
    }
	// we need to include \0 that's why n + 1
	// or i <= n
    for (int i = 0, n = strlen(s); i < n + 1; i++)
    {
        t[i] = s[i];
    }

    if (strlen(t) > 0)
    {
        t[0] = toupper(t[0]);
    }

    printf("s: %s\n", s);
    printf("t: %s\n", t);

    free(t);
}


```

`malloc()` - memory allocate
`free()` - freeing the memory previously allocated
`strcpy(str1, str2)` - for copying strings

**Anytime you use `malloc()`, you must use `free()` afterward.

## Debugging

- `valgrind` debugging tool helps you debug invalid reads, invalid writes, segmentation faults, or memory leaks (aka when you've allocated more memory than you have freed)
- to run it: `valgrind ./hi`
- You can preface it with `cs50` to get a more helpful output.

**ü§î What is a garbage value?**

- Anytime that you don't initialize the value of a variable
- If you try to dereference and uninitialized variable, your program might crash.
- Ergo, you should always initialize values before touching them (read/write) in any way üëç

```

int *x = malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
// allocate enough memory for 10 integers, and then
// store the address of that chunk of memory
// in a pointer called x.
```

**ü§î What is a buffer overflow?**

When you are overflowing the allocated memory (either stack overflow or heap overflow)

## Computer memory

In terms of standard order (you can imagine it going top to bottom):

- machine code (the 0s and 1s representing your program)
- globals (global variables)
- heap (this where you can allocate/free the memory from/to with malloc) - can lead to heap overflow
- stack - the memory for your functions, variables, parameters  (can lead to stack overflow)


```c
// swapping values in C
// note you must use pointers!
// otherwise only params a, b will be changed
// but the original x, y will remain as they were
// you wouldn't need pointers if you did all
// the swapping inside main
#include <stdio.h>

void swap(int *a, int *b);

int main(void)
{
    int x = 1;
    int y = 2;

    printf("x is %i, y is %i\n", x, y);
    swap(&x, &y);
    printf("x is %i, y is %i\n", x, y);
}

void swap(int *a, int *b)
{
    int tmp = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = tmp;
}

// vs naive, old version of swap
// that doesn't change x, y
void swap(int a, int b)
{
    int tmp = a;
    a = b;
    b = tmp;
}


```

Meaning! If you use the stack's memory you save yourself the trouble of having to do `malloc()` AND `free()` ü§Ø

```c
	char s[4];
	// vs
	char *s = malloc(4);

```


## CS50 Library

All the CS50 `get` libraries (`get_int`, `get_string`), were there to help you with pointers.
Equivalent of `get_int`:
```c
int x;
prinf("x: ");
scanf("%i", &x);
prinf("x: %i\n", x);
```

for `get_string`:
```c
char s[5];
prinf("s: ");
scanf("%s", s);
prinf("s: %s\n", s);
```

## File I/O

```c
	// C does come with a pointer type FILE
	// that... ü•Å points to a file
	FILE *file = fopen("phonebook.csv", "a");

	// always check for NULL
    if (file == NULL)
    {
        return 1;
    }
```

This is how you define a `BYTE`:
```c
	typedef uint8_t BYTE;

```

**ü§î How do you recognize a jpg file?**

The first three bytes of any `.jpg` files are: `0xff`, `0xd8` and `0xff`.

**ü§î What is a bitmap?**

A map of bits ü•Å

And, finally, this is how you copy a file, one byte at a time:

```c
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

typedef uint8_t BYTE;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    // Ensure proper usage
    if (argc != 3)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "Usage: copy SOURCE DESTINATION\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // open input file
    FILE *source = fopen(argv[1], "r");
    if (source == NULL)
    {
        printf("Could not open %s.\n", argv[1]);
        return 1;
    }

    // Open output file
    FILE *destination = fopen(argv[2], "w");
    if (destination == NULL)
    {
        fclose(source);
        printf("Could not create %s.\n", argv[2]);
        return 1;
    }

    // Copy source to destination, one BYTE at a time
    BYTE buffer;
    while (fread(&buffer, sizeof(BYTE), 1, source))
    {
        fwrite(&buffer, sizeof(BYTE), 1, destination);
    }

    // Close files
    fclose(source);
    fclose(destination);
    return 0;
}

```
