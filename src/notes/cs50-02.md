### What is compiling?

Compiling actually involves four steps:

1. preprocessing - evaluating libraries and imports
2. compiling - translating your code into assembly code
3. assembling - translating assembly code into binary
4. linking - linking all the different files into one

### Debugging

- Syntactic errors vs logical errors
- using the debugger and breakpoints

## Memory

- think of RAM (random-access memory) as a grid, 1 byte taking one space inside the grid.

```c
// this is inside CS50 IDE
bool   1 byte
char   1 byte
double 8 bytes
float  4 bytes
int    4 bytes
long   8 bytes
string ? bytes
```

## Arrays

- Arrays are used to hold values of the same data type.
- Arrays can be multidimensional.
- Array values are passed by reference.

With arrary declaration, you need to specify three things:

- type

- name

- size

**What is a (damn, you) segmentation fault ?**

When you work with data outside of your declared array. Example, you have an array with size 10, but you are accessing the element at position 11.

ü§î **What is the difference between conversion, casting, coercion?**

- **Conversion**: either implicitly or explicitly changing a value from one data type to another, e.g. a 16-bit integer to a 32-bit integer.
- **Coercion**: an implicit conversion.
- **Casting**: an explicit type conversion int() or Number()

## String

How do we know when the string ends?

- `\0` null (terminating) character where you basically "waste" one byte to indicate where the string ends.
- So a `string` with `length` 3, actually takes up 4 bytes.
- In conclusion: strings are actually just arrays of characters (there is no ü•Ñ!)

**Food for thought ü§î**

- The whole point of programming ultimately is to abstract those lower-level implementation details.

### Command-line arguments

- `argv` - argument vector aka an array of arguments
- By default, `main` returns 0.
- 0 in computer speak typically means all ok üëç

```c
int main(int argc, string argv[])
{
  printf("hello, %s\n", argv[1]);
}
else
{
  printf("hello, world\n");
}

```

- `argc`: argument count. The program's name is by default, the first argument
- `argv`: argument vector (vector is another word for `array`), is an array of strings. The first element `argv[0]` is always the name of the program. The last element is always stored at `argv[argv-1]`

### Functions

- synonyms: procedures, methods, subroutines

There are three parts in a function declaration:

1. return type
2. name
3. the argument list (comma-separated, with a type and a name)

ü§î **What is the difference between function declaration vs function definition?**

`float sum_two (int a, int b);`

```
// the definition (aka the actual recipe)
float sum_two (int a, int b)
{
  int result =  a + b;
  return result;
}
```

- Functions can have 0 (`void`) arguments or no output (also `void`).
