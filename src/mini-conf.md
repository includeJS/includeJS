**Hello** ðŸ‘‹

includeJS is thrilled to announce it's first-ever (but maybe not last!) mini-conf,

titled: **includeJS('n'friends)**

subtitle: where we get to show you what we are up to all those weekday evenings.

Is it exclusive? Yes.

Filled with a bunch of amazing and super friendly folks? Yes.

Are you going to learn stuff? Heck yes!

Should you come? Depends. Should you? ðŸ¤¨

## Speaker line-up

- **@[elisabethirg](https://twitter.com/elisabethirg)** - wtf is DevOps anyway? Let's take a look at what the research says about delivering software with speed and stability. Who are Forsgren and Westrum? And why culture eats ci/cd for brunch.

- **[@raae](https://twitter.com/raae)** - Building POW!; privacy first

- **[@britnorcodes](https://twitter.com/britnorcodes)** - Levelling up by teaching others

Each talk will be about 15 minutes with room for questions.

I'll be posting more details in the coming days, but this is the barebones.
