includeJS aims to bridge the diversity gap in tech. We're starting by concentrating on women in tech. As we get more established, we'll expand our focus to include other groups.

Our main focus is understanding JavaScript and front-end development, as well as HTML, CSS, static site generators, accessibility, web performance, user experience, web design and more! Our events are hands-on: make sure your always bring your laptop with you! 👩‍💻
