We'll be staying here for the next 4-5 years, both of us working full-time.
I'm keen to connect with the local developer/activist/volunteer community, so if you know anyone or you are one, please get in touch - probably the quickest is through Twitter @GirlsCodeMK. 

I'm particularly interested in working with refugees and minorities in tech. I've done a lot of teaching/volunteering in the past, specifically Django Girls workshops, Cryptoparties, Nodeschools, and lots of Free Code Camp meetups.

And as a side note, my first impression of Athens is: really good! Of course, Athens is way busier than our sleepy life in the Lake District, but in the few days we'd been here, we found the people friendly, the food delicious, the coffee soothingly made the same way we do it in Slovenia, and the weather a nice change. 

Gytha üêï is a star; everyone loves her and wants to pet her! The cats are happy with the abundant opportunities to sunbathe. 

I'm not particularly looking forward to driving anytime soon, but luckily we're based quite in the center (Pangrati), so everything is within walking distance - if you like walking for a while üòÖ. But damn, the Athens streets are hilly!
