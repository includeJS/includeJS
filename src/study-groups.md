I organize weekly study groups that center around learning JavaScript and computer science.

They are intended for junior and mid-level developers who are committed to learning and sharing what they've learned with others.

We meet weekly on Zoom (Europe evening timezone). We organize ourselves through Discord and follow the includeJS Code of Conduct. We particularly welcome self-taught developers and career changers from diverse backgrounds.

**If you're interested in joining one of our groups in the future, send me a Twitter DM üëç.**

So far we've studied:

- The Missing Semester (by MIT)
- The Opinionated Guide to React (by Sara Vieira)
- CS50 (by Harvard)
- You Don't Know JS (Kyle Simpson)
