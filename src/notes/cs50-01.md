## Compiling

- source code (C language) -> algorithm (compiler - `clang`) -> machine code (binary)

- A program called a **compiler** will take source code as input and produce machine code as output.

- `clang -o hello hello.c -lcs50` -> `make hello`

- **Header files** that end with `.h` refer to some other set of code, like a library, that we can then use in our program.

### Data types

- `bool` for `true` or `false`

- `char` single ASCI characters: take up 1 byte (8 bits)

- `int` number: always take up 4bytes (32 bits) of memory

- unsigned `int` is a qualifier - it doubles the positive range of values that an integer can take on (but doesn't allow for negative values). There are also other qualifiers like `short`, `long`, and `const`
  `long` really big number

- `float` number with decimals, take up 4bytes (32 bits) of memory, caution: there's a limit to how precise we can be with floats

- `double` number with many decimals, up to 8 bytes (64 bites) of memory

- `string` (must `#include <cs50.h>`)

### More complex types

- `structs` (structures)
- `typedefs` (defined types)

**🤔 How about `void`?**

- `void` is a type, but not a data type:

- functions can have a `void` return type which means they don't returns a value (like `printf`)

- functions with `void` as parameters simply take no parameter

### Placeholders for data types

- `%c` char

- `%f` float, double

- `%i` int

- `%li` long

- `%s` string

### Operators

- arithmetic operators

- boolean expressions (logical operators: `&&`, `||`, `!`, relational operators: `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`)

### Conditional statements

- `if`, `else if`, `else`

- `switch` statement

- ternary operators

### Loops

- `while`, `do while`, `for`

### Misc

- type of output -> `void main(void)` <- type of input

- All variables (when you declare them) need 2 things: type and name

- declaration vs assignment vs initialization (declaring + assigning at the same time)

### Command line

- `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `rm`, `mv`

**🤔 What is a greedy algorithm?**

- A greedy algorithm is one “that always takes the best immediate, or local, solution while finding an answer. Greedy algorithms find the overall, or globally, optimal solution for some optimization problems, but may find less-than-optimal solutions for some instances of other problems.”
