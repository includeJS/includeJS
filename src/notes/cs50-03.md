## Linear search

- Iterate across the array from left to right, trying to find the target element.

- `O(n)` - on the order of n

```c
for i from 0 to n-1
  If i-th  element is "value you are looking for"
    return true
return false
```

## Binary search

- Given a sorted array, divide and conquer by systematically eliminating half of the remaining elements (phone book) in the search for the target element.

```c
if no items
  return false
if middle item is "value you are looking for"
  return true
else if "value you are looking for" < middle item
  search left half
else if "value you are looking for" > middle item
  search right half
```

- Big O notion (on the order of)

- `O(n/2)`: Order of n/2
- `O(log2n`): order of log n

- They are approximations

ðŸ¤” **How do the algorithms compare In terms of running time (slowest -> fastest)?**

- `O(n2)` bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort
- `O(n log n)` merge sort
- `O(n)` linear search
- `O(log n)` binary search
- `O(1)`

**ðŸ¤” And what's in the opposite end of Big O?**

- `Î©` Greek Omega letter used to describe the best cases (Î© of ...)

- `Î©(n2)` selection sort
- `Î©(n log n)` merge sort
- `Î©(n)` bubble sort, insertion sort
- `Î©(log n)`
- `Î©(1)` linear search, binary search

## Custom types

**ðŸ¤” What is a struct?**
It's a container, inside which you can put multiple other data types.

```c
typedef struct
{
  string name;
  string number;
}
person;
```

## Bubble sort

- Swap adjacent pairs of elements if they are out of order, effectively bubbling larger elements to the right and smaller ones to the left.

```c
Repeat n-1 times (later changed to repeat until no swaps)
  for i from 0 to n-2
    if i'th and i+1'th elements out of order
      swap them
```

- Amounts to `O(n2)`

## Selection sort

- Find the smallest unsorted element in an array and swap it with the first unsorted element of that array.

```c
for i from 0 to n-1
  find smallest item between i'th item and last item
  swap the smallest item with the i'th item
```

Amounts to `O(n2)`

## Merge sort

- Split the full aray into subarrays, then merge those subarrays back together in the correct order.

```c
if only one item
  return
else
  sort left half of items
  sort right half of items
  merge sorted halves
```

## Î¸ Theta

for describing algorithms where `O` and`Î©` values are the same

- `Î¸(n2)` selection sort
- `Î¸(n log n)` merge sort
- `Î¸(n)`
- `Î¸(log n)`
- `Î¸(1)`

## Insertion sort

- Proceed once through the array from left to right, shifting elements as necessary to insert each element into its correct place.

## Recursion

- A function calling itself.

- Classic example is the factorial:
  `fact(n) = n * fact(n-1)`

Every factorial has two cases:

- base case: when triggered, will terminate the recursive process
- recursive case: which is where recursion actually occurs

```c
int fact(int n)
{
  if (n == 1)
    return 1;
  else
    // With single line returns, you can take the curly braces away.
    return n * fact(n-1)'
}
```
